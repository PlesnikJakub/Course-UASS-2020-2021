## Sir model - example in python

In repository [Forcoa-NET/SirModelShowCase](https://github.com/Forcoa-NET/SirModelShowCase) is implemented small example how to simulate epidemics in network.
Example demonstrates **SIR model** on **Karate Club** network.

## Task 1 - Visualize karate club in Gephi
1. Download **Karate Club** dataset from [gephi github repository](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets)
2. Open graph file in Gephi
3. Set proportional size of nodes based on degree
4. Set nodes color
5. Apply ForceAttlas layout - Explore options
6. Change label of one node from numbet to name "John"
7. Explore option in Preview tab to get clear result of graph visualization
